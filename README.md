<h1> Sales prediction using svm model </h1>
<p>
   Using support vector machine (SVM) i have created this simple which uses the linear kernel to predict sales for an organisation
   i have picked a random dataset from internet and trained this model

</p>
<p>
Since i am using python i have used several libraries here:
 <ul>
            <li>pandas</li>
            <li>sklearn</li>
            <li>matplotlib</li>
            <li>streamlit</li>
 
 </ul>
